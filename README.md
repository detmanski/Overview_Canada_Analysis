Culture Analysis: Based on the 15 cities, which has the highest participation in culture? 

We first looked at the overall participation in cultural activities. We used overall participation as a metric to decide which area had the most community involved in cultural activities and where cultural activities were most readily available. The information was based by province, as the participation in cultural activities would not be based solely within one’s city (ie. One can travel within the province to participate). For consistency with the data we did break it down to the 15 cities on the bar graph ‘cities_overall_participation.png’, however the values are the same based on the province within. It’s also notable that the overall participation was measured by using 100 – “% that did not participate.” 

We used the stacked bar graph ‘stacked_bar_culture.png’ to gain insight into the specific cultural activities available in each province. Crafting has the highest participation rate overall with music as a close second. In this way you could look at which form of culture is most important to you and choose where to live based on that availability. Form example, the only province with notable Theatre activity was Ontario. Nova Scotia has overall the highest participation in cultural activities and Quebec has the lowest. If participation or exposure to cultural activities is important to you then within our 15 cities, Halifax would be the most ideal and Quebec City or Montreal the least. 

The pie chart takes a closer look at our top cultural city, Halifax. Over 60% of the population participated in cultural activities and this looks at the break down of participation in each activity. The top 3 are crafting, making music and visual arts. For someone looking for a rich and diverse cultural experience, living in Halifax would be ideal.
